# MyLedger
MyLedger is a personal finance assistant android application which prevents the user from exceeding their expense limits and also recommends the resources to invest daily, the amount they saved on a particular day.

## What problem this application solves?
With growing awareness among the youth about managing their finances and start investing for future returns, there is a need to assist them to achieve their daily investment and savings goal. When you see and realise your limit to spend in a day and you see getting closer to that limit with each expenditure, you tends to be more responsible and reasonable for on whatever things you spent. And if you succeeds in saving some amount from your daily spend limit, what can be better reward than getting to invest that amount on the promising resources. This is what MyLedger is exactly made for.
